i am trying to convert a simple linear regression code from python to FB as part of my effort to create a ML FB library of linear regression.
well the intension is to make a library of ML linear regression in FB so when (hopefully) we'll have a working linear regression program code in FB
that's just one step the next is to make out of it a library (libLINREG) with a bi file and a libLINREG.a file so any one in FB won't have to code this
headache over and over when trying to add some linear regression calculation to his data / program

source of python code is in this site: https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-simple-linear-regression-scratch-python/

for more details please visit this post: https://www.freebasic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=28901

project repository on github: https://github.com/trapmania/libLINREG

any help or contribution will be welcome this is an open source community project...

here is the thread in forum where we are trying to do the conversion/translation of the code from python to FB: https://www.freebasic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=28908

update (23/10/2020) version 0.0.2.1:
- Paul doe posted working code that mimics the result of python code (including presenting the results as a graph) by so proving that FB linear regression program is possible 
- i offered Paul doe to become a collaborator in project - i hope he will accept invitation. the most important thing in Paul doe code is the equations function - the math equations function which i hope will be at the core of the library at the end...
- old code of attempts to convert the python code that was scrapped is now in "source/ARCHIVE" folder
- looks like there is no option but to use UDT and OOP in order to create a linear regression / python code equivalent result
- the project's github repository has been transferred to Tourist Trap he'll take charge of the project. 
update(22/10/2020) version 0.0.2:
- Tourist Trap joined the project as a collaborator.
- we decided to start from scratch and ditch the main_program.bas code with the OOP to load the csv file...
- now we start to convert\translate the python code 1 to 1 - version of code is now 0.0.2
version 0.01(21/10/2020):
- checked if python code example works (and it does) ( in "py_example/py_linear_example" )
- dataset csv in "datasets\dataset.scv" of Swedish insurance data made this will be test and train data
- source code in "source\Load_csv.bas" - an attempt to convert the py code program to a working FB code program ( so far csv file data are loaded into the program and been able to convert py code for finding means varients and find convariance of data )
update 21/10/2020:]
- today tried to convert more of the python code to FB and add it to bas source code with partial success. help is needed by others
- it seems that the python code is more accurate then the FB code using the simple test.cvs file
- found a vb code example of simple linear regression here: https://www.centerspace.net/examples/nm ... xample.php however i believe i should continue to convert the python code...
