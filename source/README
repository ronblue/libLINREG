i am trying to convert a simple linear regression code from python to FB as part of my effort to create a ML FB library of linear regression.

source of python code is in this site: https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-simple-linear-regression-scratch-python/

for more details please visit this post: https://www.freebasic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=28901

project repository on github: https://github.com/ronblue/libLINREG

any help or contribution will be welcome this is an open source community project...

update(22/10/2020) version 0.0.2 :
- Tourist Trap joined the project as a collaborator.
- we decided to start from scratch and ditch the main_program.bas code with the OOP to load the csv file... 
- now we start to convert\translate the python code 1 to 1 - version of code is now 0.0.2
version 0.01(21/10/2020):
- checked if python code example works (and it does) ( in "py_example/py_linear_example" )
- dataset csv in "datasets\dataset.scv" of Swedish insurance data made this will be test and train data
- source code in "source\Load_csv.bas" - an attempt to convert the py code program to a working FB code program ( so far csv file data are loaded into the program and been able to convert py code for finding means varients and find convariance of data )
update 21/10/2020:
- today tried to convert more of the python code to FB and add it to bas source code with partial success. help is needed by others
- it seems that the python code is more accurate then the FB code using the simple test.cvs file
- found a vb code example of simple linear regression here: https://www.centerspace.net/examples/nmath-stats/visual-basic/simple-linear-regression-example.php however i believe i should continue to convert the python code...
